# Bookbuddy.ink, your personnal library manager
## What is it ?

Bookbuddy is a progressive web app which allows you to manage (and eventually share and discuss) your personnal library.

## Why is it ?

Bookbuddy is the final group project of a 9 week long bootcamp at Le Wagon Nantes during which we learned web development with Ruby on Rails.

## How is it ?

It is a PWA made with Ruby on Rails and hosted on Heroku.
We are using Stimulus.JS, a bit of bootstrap and a lot of vanilla CSS for the frontend. The aesthetic is based on Duolinguo or Flatify CSS style.

Currently, the database used to get information on books is Open Library. We intend to pursue other API such as the BNF for french books.
